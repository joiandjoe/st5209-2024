## 1. AR(2)

Consider the AR(2) equation $$
X_t = 1.5 X_{t-1} - 0.75 X_{t-2} + W_t.
$$

a.  What is the autoregressive polynomial?

b.  What are its roots?

c.  What patterns does its ACF exhibit?

d.  Compute the general form of its ACF.

e.  Confirm d) using `AMRAacf()`.

f.  What times series pattern does this correspond to?

g.  Confirm this by simulating from this time series model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AR polynomial is

$$
\phi(z) = 1 - 1.5z +0.75z^2
$$

The roots are

$$
\frac{1.5 \pm \sqrt{(1.5)^2 - 4\cdot 0.75}}{2\cdot 0.75} = 1 \pm i/\sqrt{3}.
$$

Since the roots are complex, the ACF is a damped sinusoid.

The general form is

$$
cz_1^h + \bar c \bar z_1^h = a|z_1|^{-h}\cos(h\theta+b)
$$

where $a$ and $b$ are constants depend on initial conditions, and

$$
\begin{split}
\theta & = \arctan(Im(z_1)/Re(z_1)) \\
& = \arctan(1/\sqrt{3}) \\
& = \pi/6.
\end{split}
$$

Hence, the period of the sinusoid is 12 units.

```{r}
ARMAacf(ar = c(1.5, -0.75), lag.max = 30) |> plot()
```

The ACF corresponds to a cyclic time series pattern with an approximate period of 12.

## 2. AR(2) Part 2

Consider the AR(2) equation $$
X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + W_t.
$$

a.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ is the model causal?
b.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ does the ACF have periodic behavior?
c.  The conditions on a) are equivalent to[^1] $$
    \phi_1 + \phi_2 < 1, \quad \phi_2 - \phi_1 < 1, \quad |\phi_2| < 1.
    $$ What region in 2D does this correspond to?

[^1]: See Example 3.9 and Problem 3.5 in Shumway and Stoffer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AR polynomial is

$$
\phi(z) = 1 - \phi_1z - \phi_2z^2.
$$

Using the quadratic formula, we can write the roots of this polynomial as

$$
z_1,z_2 = \frac{\phi_1 \pm \sqrt{\phi_1^2 + 4\phi_2}}{-\phi_2}.
$$

The model is causal if $|z_1|,|z_2| > 1$.

The ACF has periodic behavior if the roots are complex. This happens if and only if

$$
\phi_2 < -\frac{\phi_1^2}{4}.
$$

We reproduce a figure from Shumway and Stoffer (2000) to illustrate geometrically the values of $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$

## 3. Linear process coefficients.

Given an AR(p) model $$
X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j},
$$ write the coefficients in terms of the parameters $\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\phi_p$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As stated in the theorem on existence and uniqueness of solutions, the coefficients are defined via the equation

$$
\phi(z)\left(\sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j z^j\right) = 1.
$$ {#eq-power-series-equality}

Here, we treat all expressions symbolically, i.e. we do not care about series convergence. The left hand side is the product of a polynomial and a power series, which gives a power series:

$$
\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j z^j
$$

The coefficients $c_0,c_1,\ldots$ can be defined by considering which terms in the product can combine to give an appropriate power of $z^j$. For instance, only the constant terms can multiply together to get a constant, so we have $c_0 = \psi_0$. To get a term with $z$, we need a multiply a constant term by one with $z$. This gives

$$
c_1 = \phi_1\psi_0 + \phi_0\psi_1.
$$

Generally, we have the formula

$$
c_k = \sum_{j=0}^p \phi_j\psi_{k-j}.
$$

If $\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j z_j$ is equal to 1 as a power series, then we must have $c_0 = 1$, $c_k = 0$ for all $k \geq 1$. This allows us to solve for $\psi_j$ recursively since for $k=1,2,\ldots$, the resulting equation

$$
\sum_{j=0}^p \phi_j \psi_{k-j} = 0
$$

can be rewritten to express $\psi_k$ in terms of $\psi_{k-1}, \psi_{k-2},\ldots,\psi_0$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. AR(1) ACF

Verify the formula for the ACVF and ACF of AR(1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

For any linear process $X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j}$, we have

$$
\gamma_X(h) = \sigma^2\sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j\psi_{j+h}
$$

Now, note that for AR(1), we have $X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \phi^j W_{t-j}$. Hence, plugging in $\psi_j = \phi^j$ gives

$$
\begin{split}
\gamma_X(h) & = \sigma^2\sum_{j=0}^\infty \phi^{2j+h} \\
& = \frac{\sigma^2\phi^h}{1-\phi^2}.
\end{split}
$$

To compute the ACF, we have

$$
\rho_X(h) = \frac{\gamma_X(h)}{\gamma_X(0)} = \phi^h.
$$
