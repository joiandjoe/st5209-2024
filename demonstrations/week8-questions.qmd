## 1. AR(2)

Consider the AR(2) equation $$
X_t = 1.5 X_{t-1} - 0.75 X_{t-2} + W_t.
$$

a.  What is the autoregressive polynomial?

b.  What are its roots?

c.  What patterns does its ACF exhibit?

d.  Compute the general form of its ACF.

e.  Confirm d) using `ARMAacf()`.

f.  What times series pattern does this correspond to?

g.  Confirm this by simulating from this time series model.

## 2. AR(2) Part 2

Consider the AR(2) equation $$
X_t = \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + W_t.
$$

a.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ is the model causal?
b.  Under what conditions on $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ does the ACF have periodic behavior?
c.  The conditions on a) are equivalent to $$
    \phi_1 + \phi_2 < 1, \quad \phi_2 - \phi_1 < 1, \quad |\phi_2| < 1.
    $$ What region in 2D does this correspond to?

## 3. Linear process coefficients.

Given an AR(p) model $$
X_t = \sum_{j=0}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j},
$$ write the coefficients in terms of the parameters $\phi_1,\phi_2,\ldots,\phi_p$.

## 4. AR(1) ACF

Verify the formula for the ACVF and ACF of AR(1).

## 5. AR(p) theorems

Understand the proofs of the theorems.
